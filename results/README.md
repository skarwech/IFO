# Results Directory

This directory contains output files from the Intelligent Pump Scheduler.

## Auto-Generated Files

When you run simulations, the following files are automatically created:

### Simulation Results

1. **baseline_results.csv**
   - Simulation results using simple baseline controller
   - Columns: timestamp, L1, V, F1_m3, F2_m3h, power_kw, etc.

2. **optimized_results.csv**
   - Simulation results using MPC-optimized controller
   - Same format as baseline for comparison

3. **comparison.csv**
   - Performance comparison metrics
   - Cost savings, energy savings, percentage improvements

4. **report.html**
   - Interactive HTML report with plots
   - Open in browser to view results

### Forecasting Models

5. **models/inflow_forecaster.pth**
   - Trained LSTM model for inflow prediction
   - Created when running in 'train' mode

### Example Outputs

6. **example_*.csv**
   - Results from running examples
   - Generated by `examples/example_usage.py`

## Usage

Results are created automatically:

```bash
# Generate results
python main.py --mode simulate --use-sample-data --days 14 --output results

# View HTML report
# Open results/report.html in browser

# Analyze CSV results
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('results/optimized_results.csv')
```

## Directory Structure

```

## Cleaning Results

To start fresh:

```bash
# Windows
del results\*.csv results\*.html

# Linux/Mac
rm results/*.csv results/*.html
```

Or selectively keep models:

```bash
# Keep models, delete results
del results\*.csv results\*.html
# models/ directory preserved
```
